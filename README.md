All character art, tileart, and animations designed by me

# About Me
As a creator at heart, I wanted to design a unique experience where computer science and art intersect, by creating‬ original pixel art, animations, and narrative-driven gameplay‬

Through this project, I continue to learn C#; practice good code structure and object oriented design; and apply finite state automation and enemy AI.

Lastly, I end this off with a heartfelt thank you to GameCodeLibrary and Sebastian Lague for their amazing code-along tutorials. They have made learning Unity and C# so much easier and more enjoyable.
